# ELKStack-Getting-to-Kibana-4

Vagrant Configuration used during my Elastic User Group Meetup talk.

Traversing the migration path from Kibana 3 to Kibana 4 can be tricky, challenging and a little frustrating, 
but without a doubt it's worth it.  The goal of this presentation will be to review the challenges, 
provide tips and walk through a migration from a Kibana 3 environment to Kibana 4.
